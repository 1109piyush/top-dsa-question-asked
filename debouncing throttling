debouncing after certain period it run 
  psedu code 
  useEffect(()=>
           get data = setimeout ()
            axiost.get 
            reposnse .then
              },3000}
it will call function after 3 second only but we stop it again start if someone input in 3 second
            clearinterval(())=> return (getdata)
)


  Throttling: Throttling is a similar technique to debouncing, but instead of delaying the execution of a function, it limits the rate at which a function. This is useful when a function, such as a mousemove or keydown event listener, may be called repeatedly but need not be run each time.

Throttling is a technique in which, no matter how many times the user fires the event, the attached function will be executed only once in a given time interval. Throttling ensures that the function executes at regular intervals.
